# Landing Page Project

### Aim of the project:

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

### Project exuction:

##### index file updates:

   - Added a forth section.

   - Made the sections collapsible.

##### css file updates: 

   - Added a red border to the active section to make active state while scrolling more visible.
 
##### js added functionalities: 

   - Creating an unordered list each containing the corresponding section attributrs.

   - Added active state to the section when reaching half the viewport and remove it after its bottom passes it (not just when the section top is in viewport).

   - Preventing the default action for clicking the anchor links and adding a smooth scroll method.
